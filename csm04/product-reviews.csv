Good product with average battery life","Likes:1) Build quality is premium with glass front and back.2) Processor & RAM are fast for the application.3) Screen is of good quality with dynamic refresh rate.4) Camera performance good. But low light photo on wide angle camera is average or below average.5) 80W charger bundled in the box, charges the phone very quickly.6) Alert slider very convenient.Dislikes:1) Quite a few pre-installed one plus apps. Not all are very useful.2) Battery life is very average for a phone with 5000mAh battery. Also noticed that idle drain of the battery is very high.",OR,Neutral

Awesome Phone at 38000 ruppees, Display fantastic, Camera Fantastic, overall awesome","Pretty awesome phone under 40k, Maybe the Oneplus 11r is even better, but the only differences between these are the curved display(the display is the same in both, but here it's flat, there it's curved), back design, and Processor. Mediatek Dimensity 9000 works fantastic for even hardcore games. The display is super smooth, super large, and crystal clear. The battery lasts a day, Overall no complaints on any point except for the back design being so bland.",OR,Neutral

Good phone, but could've been better","I bought this for taking photos, it takes good photos but not great ones. I guess the older 1+ were having great camera was capable of capturing great photos, but this one captures photos with more sharpness. Apart from that, everything else is same as other phones. It has a decent battery life, the AMOLED screen is great, RAM and CPU performance is good. I've played Asphalt 9, it doesn't lag while gaming (Not a hardcore gamer). Doesn't heats up. So overall a good phone, but I am a bit disappointed because, the price has been reduced, cause I bought it for 34K right after the launch, but now for 34K, 16G RAM version is available.",OR,Negative

Good phone with little hiccups, Horrible battery experience","Everything about this phone is good but I found one major and one minor issue.  Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast. Dimensity 9000 is performing incredibly superb. No complaints on performance side.Update:- They are not fixing the battery drain.",OR,Neutral

Good product with average battery life","Likes:1) Build quality is premium with glass front and back.2) Processor & RAM are fast for the application.3) Screen is of good quality with dynamic refresh rate.4) Camera performance good. But low light photo on wide angle camera is average or below average.5) 80W charger bundled in the box, charges the phone very quickly.6) Alert slider very convenient.Dislikes:1) Quite a few pre-installed one plus apps. Not all are very useful.2) Battery life is very average for a phone with 5000mAh battery. Also noticed that idle drain of the battery is very high.",OR,Neutral

Awesome Phone at 38000 ruppees, Display fantastic, Camera Fantastic, overall awesome","Pretty awesome phone under 40k, Maybe the Oneplus 11r is even better, but the only differences between these are the curved display(the display is the same in both, but here it's flat, there it's curved), back design, and Processor. Mediatek Dimensity 9000 works fantastic for even hardcore games. The display is super smooth, super large, and crystal clear. The battery lasts a day, Overall no complaints on any point except for the back design being so bland.",OR,Neutral

Good phone, but could've been better","I bought this for taking photos, it takes good photos but not great ones. I guess the older 1+ were having great camera was capable of capturing great photos, but this one captures photos with more sharpness. Apart from that, everything else is same as other phones. It has a decent battery life, the AMOLED screen is great, RAM and CPU performance is good. I've played Asphalt 9, it doesn't lag while gaming (Not a hardcore gamer). Doesn't heats up. So overall a good phone, but I am a bit disappointed because, the price has been reduced, cause I bought it for 34K right after the launch, but now for 34K, 16G RAM version is available.",OR,Negative

Good phone with little hiccups, Horrible battery experience","Everything about this phone is good but I found one major and one minor issue.  Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast. Dimensity 9000 is performing incredibly superb. No complaints on performance side.Update:- They are not fixing the battery drain.",OR,Neutral

Very good mid range Phone.",Both Front and back Camera Quality is absolutely amazing. Best Screen Quality. Best Sound Quality. The best in Looks. Looks so premium like iPhone. Superfast Charging Capability.Only drawback I found by using this phone from past 14 days is that battery drains fast. But I feel it's not a matter of concern as charging is superfast but I guess it may not be suitable for heavy mobile users or  for those who play games in phone most of the time.,OR,Neutral
